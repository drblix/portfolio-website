                                My junior-year capstone project that I worked on with one other person who assisted with art.
                                A satirical game which transforms teachers from my school into killer animatronics akin to those in the popular game "Five Nights at Freddy's".
                                I can proudly say this game was present on every student's computer monitor until the end of the year (can't say the teachers were as happy).

                            So, interesting story for these two menu tracks that I made for Five Nights at Jacobson (FNAJ).
                            The first menu theme was created with an interesting synth I made by complete accident in FL Studio, but hey, it sounded cool!<br><br>
                            The second menu theme was a complete overhaul of the first theme, since I thought the game got scarier as we went further into the development process, but everyone seemed to love the first theme more than the second! Though, I guess the second is less of a theme and more so ambiance?
                            Maybe less actually is more? 🤔<br><br>
                            Fun fact: some of the high-pitched chimes in the second theme is a heavily distorted recording of me hitting a nail with a hammer in my garage.

                            A very calming (or at least it tries to be) classical piece that was intended to be used for a game project where you free roam the world in a massive hot air balloon.
                            Unfortunately, the project as of now has been scrapped since I lost interest, but I might return to it some day!

                            An upbeat electronic track I created to practice mixing and propper panning with instruments. Also a sneaky bit of keyboard thrown in there because you can never go wrong with that.
                            I actually really enjoyed how it turned out, despite being relatively basic.
                            Oh also it's unnamed, so name it whatever you think fits I guess.

                            A very L.A. Noire inspired piano swing piece. Probably one of the most complicated lead melody parts I've composed to this date.
                            I feel like it's a little bumpy at some points, but my excuse is Jazz: the genre where mistakes and unintentional rhythms are APART of the composition!
