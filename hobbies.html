                    <p>As someone who has tinkered with technology around the same time I learned to walk, lots of my hobbies revolve around computers! </p>
                    <p>One of my biggest hobbies is game development: while I don't host any major published games, I have a lot of unfinished, open source game projects hosted on my GitHub account. Creating game mechanics has always been fun, but not something I could ever finish, for some reason.</p>
                    <p>Quite a cliche, but it's not really a lie in some cases: reading is a key to new worlds. One of my favourite series of all time is Lord of the Rings (Hobbit included). I don't know how Tolkien did it, but he created one of the most compelling series I've ever read. Some of my other favourite authors are George Orwell, Jack London, Mark Twain, and many others.</p>
